    <td>I mainly learnt from the booklet this lesson, as I read through it thoroughly before I copy it onto our computer. I don't find just copying code of of a workbook is the most effective way to learn, because sometimes you just copy the work down without knowing what it is actually doing. I think it would be more effective if we created our own code and refer back to the book for help. I think the reason why it is more effective is because it is making us think more than we are currently.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think working with a partner limited my learning slightly due to us sharing the work. Also capital letter and misspelling words hindered us quite a bit, because with coding you have to be very precise when you type and the computer picks up on very small mistakes.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next I will be more efficient with my work, and get things right first time, so we can get more done in our one hour time limit. Also next time I think I will be doing more of the typing so that we can get more work done because I am a slightly faster at typing and donâ€™t make as many mistakes.</td>
