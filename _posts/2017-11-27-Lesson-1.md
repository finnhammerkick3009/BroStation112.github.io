    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The best learning method for this lesson was to listen to the teacher, apply your previous knowledge and use trial and error. I think listening to the teacher built up my knowledge has I do have some previous experience with excel. Also applying my previous knowledge meant I could get ahead of the class and go into more complex work. Trial and error worked sometimes, when working on the minor code. But it definitely helped to understand what is actually going on by listening to the teacher. Cheers Mr Tansley.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think nothing limited my learning today because I worked very productively. Expect maybe helping people around me, as I am almost re-learning work I have already completed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think next time maybe focus more on my own work to optimise my learning. Also I think getting ahead before the next lesson is a good idea so in the future lessons be able to go on to harder more complicated code. I think if I do challenge myself in this upcoming term I will be able to make the most out of it, and have a good term of IT. Also quickly I do have experience with excel spreadsheets so I am pretty confident of my own ability.
